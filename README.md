# Promotion-response-rate-prediction
Improve the promotion response rate of commercial offers using machine leaning

# Domain Background
To provide the next best offer to customers is a main topic in marketing. The goal is to predict the
optimal personalized product offer to each individualized customers. As a consequence it will improve
the chance that a customer uses the offer and then it will increase the promotion response rate. Another
benefit is to improve the customer satisfaction by avoiding spamming.
With a high number of data and features to analyze, it requires a real time automated self-learning
decision. Using machine learning algorithms is then necessary to create such model.

# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to predict if an offer will be well received by different customers. In other
words the goal is to determine if a customer will use an offer or not.
This binary problem can be solved by using a machine learning algorithm based on a binary
classification. This is the solution we will investigate in this project.
